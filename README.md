#### This project primarily focuses on:

-   [x] **Classes** : implementing classes with methods, getters, and setters to incorporate the desired logic and functionality into the specified classes.
-   [x] **Inheritance** : inheriting from the time class in other classes such as clock, countdown and stopper preserved the initial time logic, reducing code duplication and ensuring easier maintenance.
-   [x] **Tests** : comprehensive test coverage for all functions, methods, classes, and utility functions to ensure their proper functionality and achieve full test coverage: <br />
